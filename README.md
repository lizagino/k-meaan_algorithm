Crypto Clustering
Welcome to the Crypto Clustering project! In this challenge, you'll apply your financial Python programming skills and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency price change data over different periods.

Introduction
The provided CSV file contains valuable price change data for cryptocurrencies, and your task is to cluster these cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns. This project is divided into several sections, each with specific objectives:

Import the Data: We provide starter code to help you import the cryptocurrency price change data.

Prepare the Data: You'll prepare the data for analysis, ensuring it's in the right format for clustering.

Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data: Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for your dataset using the original data.

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data: Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to group cryptocurrencies based on their price changes.

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Enhance your clustering results by using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data: Find the best value for k after applying PCA.

Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data: Re-cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA-transformed data.

Visualize and Compare the Results: Create visualizations to understand and compare the clustering results.
